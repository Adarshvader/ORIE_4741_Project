"We Didn't Start the Fire: A Look into the Ways Music has Changed with the State of the World"
NetIDs: amg369, edk55, am2236

We are researching this question to find if there is a clear pattern between how the emotional climate of the world impacts songwriting. We would like to look at what people are drawn to the most in songs, and find if it reflects what people care about most in the real world. We're likely to succeed in answering our question as music has always been an avenue for people to express their thoughts about the state of the world, politically and socially. We hypothesize that there is an obvious connection between musical lyrics and society's reflection on these events.

138," ""Ragnar The Red"" lyrics in FI  FR  JA  RU  SR  SV  TO  Skyrim Lyrics Ragnar The Red lyrics translated in Seven Languages   Singer  Skyrim  There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red  Who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!    And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade  As he told of bold battles and gold he had made!    But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red  When he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said...    ""Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead!  Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!""    And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel  As the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!    And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree...  When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!    Olipa kerran sankari nimeltä Ragnar Punainen  Joka tuli ratsain Whiteruniin vanhasta Roriksteadista!  Ja kerskailija rehvasteli ja heilutteli miekkaansa  Kun hän kertoi urhoollisista taisteluista ja kullasta jonka oli ansainnut!    Mutta sitten hiljeni hän, Ragnar Punainen  Kun hän tapasi kilpineito Matildan joka sanoi...    ""Voi, sinä puhut ja valehtelet ja juot kaiken simamme!  Nyt luulen että sinun on korkea aika maata maassa ja vuotaa verta!""    Ja niin kävi teräksen kalske ja sivallus  Kun rohkea likka Matilda hyökkäsi intoa täynnä!    Ja kerskailija nimeltä Ragnar ei ollut rehvasteleva enääääää...  Kun hänen ruma punainen päänsä vieri lattialla!      Il était une fois un héros nommé Ragnar le Rouge  Qui est venu à cheval à Blancherive de ole Rorikbourg!    Et le fanfaron fait des fanfaronnades et brandi sa lame  Comme il a dit à des batailles audacieuses et l'or qu'il avait fait!    Mais ensuite, il se calme, fit Ragnar le Rouge  Quand il a rencontré la guerrière Matilda qui a dit ...    ""Oh, vous parlez et vous mentez et vous buvez toute notre hydromel!  Maintenant, je pense qu'il est grand temps que vous vous couchez et saignez! ""    Et puis vint le choc et le tronçonnage de l'acier  Comme la jeune fille courageuse Matilda était chargé en plein de zèle!    Et le fanfaron nommé Ragnar n'était pluuuuuuus vantard...  Quand sa tête laide rouge roulait autour sur le plancher!      あるところに赤のラグナルという英雄がいて  古きロリクステッドからホワイトランへやって来た！    その自慢屋は威張り歩き、大胆な戦いと  稼いだ金の話をしながら剣を振りかざした！    ところが彼は静かになった。赤のラグナルは、  シールドメイデンのマチルダに言われたのだ…    「あなたは嘘ばかり話して、私たちのハチミツ酒を全部飲んだわ！  今こそ眠りにつく時よ！」    そして勇敢な少女マチルダは  熱を込めて突進し、鋼で潰して切った。    自慢屋のラグナルはもう２度と自慢しなかった…  彼の醜く赤い頭が床を転がったのだ！      Жил да был Рагнар Рыжий, героем он слыл  Как то раз он в Вайтран ненадолго прибыл    Он куражился, пыжился, бряцал мечом  Похваляясь что враг ему всяк нипочем    Но вдруг Рагнар Рыжий как лютик поник  Он услышал Матильды насмешливый крик    Что блажишь ты, что врешь, что ты мед здесь наш пьешь?  С нас довольно, готовься, сейчас ты умрешь!    Лязг стали о сталь беспрестанно звенел  И Матильды воинственный дух пламенел    И унял с тех пор Рагнар хвастливую речь...  ...как слетела башка его рыжая с плеч!

Ali tad je utihnuo, Ragnar Crveni  Kad je upoznao ratnicu Matildu koja reče...    ""O, pričaš i lažeš i ispijaš svu našu medovinu!  Sad mislim da je vreme da legneš i krvariš!""    A onda poče okršaj i udaranje čelika  I hrabra devojka Matilda jurnu puna žara!    I hvalisavac zvani Ragnar razmetljiv ne beše više...  Kad se njegova ružna crvena glava zakotrlja na podu!      Det var en gång en hjälte som hette Ragnar den röda  Som red från Whiterun från gamla Rorikstead  Och skrytmånsen stoltserade och svängde sitt blad  När han berättade om djärva strider och guld han hade gjort    Men sen blev han tyst, Ragnar den röda  När han mötte sköldmön Matilda som sa    ""Åh, du pratar och du ljuger och du dricker all vår mjöd!  Nu tycker jag att det är hög tid att du ligger ner och blöder    Och så kom smällen och huggningen av stål  Medans den modiga flickan Matilda laddade full av iver    Och skrytmånsen som hette Ragnar var inte längre skrytsam  När hans fula röda huvud rullade runt på golvet!

217, There were two men down And the score tied In the bottom of the eighth When the pitcher died And they laid his spikes On the pitcher's mound And his uniform was torn And his number was left on the ground Then the night turned cold Colder than the moon The stars were white as bones The stadium was old Older than the screams Older than the teams There were three men down And the season lost And the tarpaulin was rolled Upon the winter frost,sad
218,I think I understand The reason you won't stay with me You think a ring upon your hand Will solve your insecurity  So go ahead and play your games It that's what you must do Nothing here remains the same But the way I feel for you  I can watch you walk away And I know that I'll get by And I know just what to say But honey I can't tell a lie  So figure out what you must do I know you think you're so damn clever You can marry anytime you want But a lover is forever,sad
219," I gave her money I gave her time I gave her everything Inside one heart could find I gave her passion My very soul I gave her promises And secrets so untold   And she promised me forever And a day we’d live as one We made our vows We’d live a life anew And she promised me in secret That she'd love me for all time It’s a promise so untrue Tell me what will I do?   And it doesn't seem to matter And it doesn't seem right ‘Cause the will has brought no fortune Still I cry alone at night Don't you judge of my composure ‘Cause I'm lying to myself And the reason why she left me Did she find in someone else?

Somebody hurt my soul, now  I can’t take this stuff no more   I am the damned I am the dead I am the agony inside The dying head This is injustice Woe unto thee I pray this punishment Would have mercy on me   And she promised me forever That we'd live our life as one We made our vows We'd live a love so true It seems that she has left me For such reasons unexplained I need to find the truth But see what will I do   And it doesn't seem to matter And it doesn't seem right ‘Cause the will has brought no fortune Still I cry alone at night Don't you judge of my composure ‘Cause I'm bothered everyday And she didn't leave a letter She just up and ran away   It is a friend of mine?  Is it my brother?  Somebody hurt my soul, now  I can't take it cause I'm lonely   Heehee, heehee! Don't try to pick me Don't try, quit it I never was, I never would Just won't stop Don't bother me Don't bother me   It is a friend of mine?  Tell me, I'm bothered!  Somebody hurt my soul, now  I can't take it cause I'm lonely   And it doesn't seem to matter  And it doesn't seem right  'Cause the will has brought no fortune Still I cry alone at night Don't you judge of my composure  'Cause I'm lying to myself And the reason why she left me Did she find in someone else?   And it doesn't seem to matter  And it doesn't seem right  'Cause the will has brought no fortune Still I cry alone at night  Don't you judge of my composure 'Cause I'm bothered every day And she didn't leave a letter She just upped and ran away   And it doesn't seem to matter And it doesn't seem right  'Cause the will has brought no fortune Still I cry alone at night Don't you judge of my composure  'Cause I'm lying to myself And the reason why she left me  Did she find in someone else?

Subordinate terror, kickin' off an era Cold deliverin' pain My '98 was '87 on a record, yo So now I go Bronco  Crucifixion ain't no fiction Socalled chosen frozen Apology made to whoever pleases Still they got me like Jesus I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce 'Bout a brother while I'm in sync Every brother ain't a brother 'cause a color Just as well could be undercover Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab Told a Rab get off the rag Sad to say, I got sold down the river Still some quiver when I deliver Never to say I never knew or had a clue Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard Lies, scandalizin', basin' Traits of hate, who's celebratin' with Satan? I ropeadope the evil with righteous, bobbin' and weavin' And let the good get even C'mon down  But welcome to the Terrordome   Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em Snakes blowing up the lines of design  Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em How to fight the power, cannot run and hide But it shouldn't be suicide In a game, a fool without the rules Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize Every brother ain't a brother 'Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man The shooting of Huey Newton From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig   It's weak to speak and blame somebody else When you destroy yourself First, nothin' worse Than a mother's pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst Can't wait for the state to decide the fate So this jam I dedicate Places with the racist faces Example, one of many places Greek, weekend, speech, I speak From a lesson, learned in Virginia I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin' But it's on bass and drums, even violins Whatcha do, getcha head ready Instead of getting physically sweaty When I get mad, I put it down on a pad, huh! Give ya something that ya never had Controllin', fear of high rollin' God bless your soul and keep livin' Never allowed, kickin' it loud Droppin' a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam Move as a team, never move alone But welcome to the Terrordome",angry
